# SUTT_Task1

This is the task 1 for the SUTT application

I have made mainly two stateful classes and one stateless class for hot reload. In the first stateful class, I have coded for the home screen. In the second stateful class, I have coded for the message screen.

The app, as demanded, changes from follow to following on click, opens message window on clicking message, and shows a pop up of user added after clicking add. The basic UI is simple covering all the basics that were mentioned in the task file.

Extra features I have added: custom names: the user can add custom names for profile, and add displays the name of the user as well. [This feature can be disabled as well] dark mode: I tried to write the code for it, watching tutorials and all. But I encountered an error, for which I was unable to find a solution with my limited knowledge. pop-up for video and voice call button in chat window. message gets cleared once you send the text and a pop-up telling us that the message was sent is shown random numbers: For followers,following and posts, a new number is generated each time we add a user.
